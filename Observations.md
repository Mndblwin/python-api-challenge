#OBSERVATIONS

1.  The Max_Temp vs Latitude plot would indicate that as cities closer to the equarter incurr a greater rise in temperature.  Inversely, as cities are located further away from the equater, the Max_Temp gradually decreases.
2.  It seems that there is no correlation between humidity and latitude
3.  There is a slight correlation in wind speed and latitude in the northern hemisphere.  But otherwise, the two do not seem correlated.
